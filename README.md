Solves Zero to Twelve problem

It is possible to assign a whole number ( +ve or –ve ) to each letter in the spelling of one,
two, three such that when you add the values of each letter it equates to the same as the
written no. For example:-
If O = -2, N = 2, E = 1, T = 7, H = 3, R = -9, W = -3,
Then,
O + N + E = ( -2 ) + 2 + 1 = 1
T + W + O = 7 + (-3) + (-2) = 2
T + H + R + E + E = 7 + 3 + (-9) + 1 + 1 =3
It is possible to assign similar whole number values to the letters, with each letter having its
own distinct value ( ie no repeating ) for the words representing 0 – 12 such that their sums
equate to their meaning. Eg Z + E + R O = 0, O + N + E = 1, T + W + O = 2 all the way through
to T + W + E + L + V + E = 12.
Can you find the values that need to be assigned to all the required letters, from the
numbers zero to twelve, remembering each letter must have a distinct value and 0 can be
assigned to a letter if required.
